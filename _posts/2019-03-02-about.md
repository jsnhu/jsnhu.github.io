## Jason Hu

I'm a first-year student at the University of British Columbia intending to
specialize in Math and Computer Science. I have an itch for workforce optimization and this blog is mostly about my optimization projects.

If you believe my scheduling services can be of use to you, please don't hesitate to ask. I would be happy to discuss.

Thanks for popping by!
